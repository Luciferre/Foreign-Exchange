The format of the result is:
time, max bid, min bid, mean bid, spread, lable

The time is the minute of day, which can be used for time align. And it can also be a factor of price.

The max, min and mean bid are generated in a 5-minute window before this record. 
I choose 5-minute window because 1-minute window is too small, which will cause price changing too fast. So the 5-minute window should be more effective for later use.

The spread is the difference between the bid and ask. The movement of spread can also predict the direction.

The lable is either 1 or 0. 
1 means this record'a bid is bigger than or equal with the previous one, and 0 means a smaller bid price compared to the last record.
